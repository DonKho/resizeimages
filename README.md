"# resizeimages" 

this apps will help you to resize images into specified width/height pixels automatically.

i create this script due to one of my problems , there are 6000 files large files with 8-10 mb files each files.
needs to create thumbnail with small size. it would be hard if i should convert one by one,
so i create this tiny scripts.

take a look at resize_images.php file , edit location orginal folder images and results based on your own needs.
specify your target of width and height pixels

and run the files. in one moment you can convert hundred of thousand images instantly
